The project focused on analyzing a bank marketing campaign to understand the psychological and behavioral dynamics of potential customers towards new term deposit proposals. Utilizing multidimensional matrices such as trend analysis, demographic dividends, existential status, and ideological and attention perception, the study aimed to uncover fundamental insights into customer behavior and campaign effectiveness.

Key findings include:

1. A notable improvement in positive outcomes, starting at 3.69% in 2017 and peaking at 55.07% conversion rate in Q2 2019, with significant growth observed in Q3 2018.
2. Variations in campaign effectiveness across employment sectors, with students and retired individuals demonstrating higher interest and conversion rates than other groups.
3. The impact of call duration on success rates, highlighting that medium-duration calls (1000-2500 seconds) yielded the highest positive purchase rate of approximately 60%.
4. Demographic insights revealed middle-aged adults with fewer loan commitments had a positive purchase rate of 9.21%, while teenagers exhibited the highest positive purchase rate at 38.30%.

This project aimed to provide actionable insights to enhance future bank marketing strategies through a deep understanding of customer preferences and behaviors.
